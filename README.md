# Datapacker

A datapack "library" mod, that adds various new commands and other stuff to do things you could not previously do (or easily do) on datapacks.

>You can check out the list of commands over in [List of Commands](<Docs/Command List.md>)

In the future there will be more features, and some not even involving commands<br>
Im checking out what cool ideas can be done from the datapack folder, custom file types and other stuff
