# Velocity Command

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `/velocity <target> <x> <y> <z>`

---
### \<TARGET>

The entity you want to change its velocity, can be a player, or anything else

---
### \<X> \<Y> \<Z>
The vector in which you want the entity to get launched in<br>
I recommend small values, 1 is already quite strong
